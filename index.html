    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>My name is Hugo Arica, I am 14 years old and currently attend Francis Lewis High School. Currently this summer I go to All Star code virtually and it's a great program and would highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in computer science or game design. This week we were working on HTML and CSS hence the reason we're making a website so I decided to make my top 5 list of animes. These are most of the anime that I watch and also my favorite, most have a reason to be my favorite because some sort of meaning in the show. </p>
    <h2>
        1. Dragon Ball Z/Super
    </h2>
    <div id="Goku">
        <img src="images/dbs.jpg">

    </div>
    <p>Dragon Ball Super is about a man named Goku who is a saiyan meaning that he is an alien. He enjoys fighting strong people and his way of life is simply to get stronger. This is my number one show because this was the first anime show that I ever watched. It also is the show that I always watch with my dad so whenever thinking about or watching this show it reminds me of him and the amazing times that I have with him. Additionally we can't wait for the next part of Dragon Ball Super to come out, we've been waiting for so long that I been relying on the manga to continue to stay up to date with what it going to happen in the show. </p>
    <h2>
        2. Naruto/Shippuden
    </h2>
    <div id="NarutoUzumaki">
        <img src="images/naruto-shippuden-1131.jpg" >
    </div>
    <p>
        Naruto, and Naruto Shippuden is about a boy named Naruto who's parents died when fighting a man named Obito and also the nine tailed beast Kurama. Naruto goes through most of his life being a jinchuriki who people mainly fear because of the beast that they have sealed within them. I really like this show and it is put in my number two spot because of how strong Naruto is. Even though sometimes it may seem that everyone is against him he still keeps fighting to get stronger and achieve his dream to become hokage. All the time he pushes past his limit fighting along his time and getting stronger. At a time in Naruto his rival Sasuke Uchiha becomes a rogue ninja and Naruto does everything that he can to find him not just for himself but for the other person on his team Sakura. This indeed is a very complicated story.

    <h2>
        3. Attack On Titan
    </h2>
    <div id="Eren">
        <img src="images/AOT.jpg">
    </div>
    <p>Attack on Titan is another fantastic show about a kid named Eren who dreams of becoming a scouts to slay all the titans and it wasn't until his own mother was eaten by a titan that he realized that this was something that he had to do until he realizes that he has the ability to turn in a titan. This anime takes my number three spot because its another anime that I enjoy watching with my dad and it once again it about a kid who never gives up and always does everything that he can to fight back against the enemy.</p>
    <h2>
        4. My Hero Acedamia
    </h2>
    <div id="Deku">
        <img src="images/MyHeroAcedamia.jpg">

    </div>

  
    <p>My Hero Acedamia is a great show about another kid who strives to work hard and fight against the enemy to save those who can't save themselves. He lives in a civilization where people have powers called quirks. However Izuku Midoriya(Deku) was born with one and his dream to become a hero was to to be flushed. However he never gave up hope until one day a villian attacks him and Midoriya is saved by the number hero All Might. Soon All Mights power will die and so All Might decides to transfer his power to Midoriya and he can now become the hero that he always wanted to be. This shows people never to give up even if its impossible you should always try to make it possible and when you fail get back up and go beyond PLUS ULTRA.</p>
    <h2>
        5. Demon Slayer
    </h2>
    <div id="Tanjiro">
        <img src="images/DemonSlayer.jpg">
    </div>
    <p>Demon Slayer as it may suggest in the name is about a boy who gets his entire family slaughtered by demons. So he decides to join the demon slayer corp to fight off these monsters, however he then finds out that his sister Nezuko has become a demon but she is different from others. She helps her brother Tanjiro to fight these creatures. This takes my top 5 slot because of its story, its simply and amzing and well thought out story and is extremely interesting.</p>
